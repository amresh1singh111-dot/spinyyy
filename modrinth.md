# SplinecartUnlocked

**SplinecartUnlocked** is a continuation fork of **[Splinecart](https://github.com/FoundationGames/Splinecart)** by **FoundationGames**, ported to and rebuilt for **Minecraft 26.3** (Fabric).

Minecarts that ride smooth, curving tracks. SplinecartUnlocked lets you lay tracks that gently bank, dip, twist, and climb - built with proper cubic-spline interpolation instead of the usual straights and 90° turns.

## Features

- **Curved tracks** - build smooth spline tracks connecting two Track Ties blocks, with natural curves and banks.
- **Automatic minecart support** - standard minecarts travel along tracks forwards and backwards, and stop cleanly.
- **Compatible carts** - any entity in the `splinecartunlocked:carts` entity tag can ride the tracks.
- **Three track types:**
  - **Track** - standard track with natural friction.
  - **Chain Drive Track** - powered track that pulls minecarts along at a constant speed, even uphill.
  - **Magnetic Track** - responds to redstone; signal strength accelerates or slows minecarts.
- **Inversions & banks** - riders are positioned correctly through loops and never suffocate in supporting blocks on inverted or sideways sections.
- **No fall damage** - riders survive leaving the track without fall damage.
- **Smooth physics** - no more stuttering at segment boundaries; carts respond appropriately to slopes.
- **Survival-friendly** - everything is craftable with hint tooltips and a HUD showing track placement status.

## Getting Started

1. Craft and place **Track Ties**. Right-click a placed tie to rotate it.
2. Craft a **Track** and right-click two ties in sequence to draw the spline track between them (use it on any non-track block to cancel the first selection).
3. Push a minecart or compatible cart onto the track and let it ride.
4. Use **Chain Drive Track** to pull carts, or power a **Magnetic Track** with redstone (signal strength controls speed) to speed up or slow down carts.

### Crafting

| Item | Recipe |
| --- | --- |
| Track Ties x8 | 1 stick in the center, wooden slabs around the edges |
| Track x4 | rail with an iron block above and below |
| Chain Drive Track x4 | activator rail, iron chains on the sides, iron blocks above and below |
| Magnetic Track x4 | powered rail, copper blocks on the sides, iron blocks above and below |

## Configuration

Client-side options, changeable in-game:

```
/splinecart config <option> [value]
```

| Option | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `rotate_camera` | `true` | Follow the track's rotation with the camera while riding. Set to `false` for users prone to motion sickness. |
| `vbos` | `false` | Render tracks using vertex buffer objects. Faster, but can cause visual artifacts. |
| `track_resolution` | `3` | Number of segments tracks are cut into when rendering (1-16). Higher = smoother, lower performance. |
| `track_render_distance` | `8` | Distance (in chunks) at which tracks stop rendering (4-32). |
| `notify_updates` | `true` | Show update status when joining a world. Disabled means you're only notified when an update is available. |

## Requirements

- Minecraft 26.3
- Fabric Loader 0.19.3+
- Fabric API
